Assembly Language Processor in C

This project is a macro assembler written in C that processes assembly source files, expands macros, and generates machine code. It was developed as part of a C programming course project by Almog Mordechai and Raz Hershko.

🚀 Features

✅ Macro expansion - Handles macro definitions and replaces them in code.

✅ Two-pass assembler - Parses and processes the assembly instructions in two stages.

✅ Symbol table management - Stores and tracks labels and variables.

✅ Error detection - Identifies syntax errors and reserved word misuse.

✅ Output file generation - Creates .ob, .ent, and .ext files.

📁 Project Structure

File

Description

MACRO.c

Processes macros and manages macro storage.

MAIN.c

Main entry point of the program.

STAGE_ONE.c

First pass: Parses assembly instructions, labels, and directives.

STAGE_TWO.c

Second pass: Generates machine code and symbol tables.

TO_FILE.c

Manages file output for assembled code.

HELP.c

Utility functions for parsing and processing.

LISTS.c

Handles linked lists for managing instructions.

main.h

Header file with function prototypes and definitions.

makefile

Automates the compilation process.

⚙️ Installation and Compilation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)

make utility (for automated compilation)

Compilation

Use the included makefile to compile:

make

This will generate an executable named main.

Cleaning Up

To remove compiled files:

make clean

🖥️ Usage

Run the assembler with an assembly source file:

./main file.as

This will process file.as and output:

file.ob - Machine code

file.ent - Entry symbols

file.ext - External symbols

Example

To process example.as, run:

./main example.as

Expected output files:

example.ob

example.ent

example.ext

📝 Code Example

Input (example.as):

mcr HELLO
    mov r1, r2
endmcr

HELLO

Expanded Output (after_macro.am):

mov r1, r2

Machine Code Output (example.ob):

0001 0010 1100
0002 1011 0000

❌ Error Handling

If an invalid macro name is used:

Error: You are trying to deploy a macro name that is not allowed.

If a file does not exist:

Error Macro: cannot open the source file

If memory allocation fails:

Memory allocation failed in macro.

🎯 Project Goal

This assembler was created to convert a high-level assembly language into machine code while handling macros, labels, and instructions efficiently. It is part of a C programming course project to provide hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts.
